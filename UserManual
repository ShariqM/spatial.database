The Track Particle Tracking System provides an interface for simulating
billiard moves on a table. They have positions and velocities which are
limited by the boundaries of the table and their equal radius. Requests
may be made for balls that are within some distance of eachother or 
some point, as well as the possibility of simulating time.

Input is free format and consists of continuous commands. Commands
can be ended by starting a new line or simply entering a semicolon.

	> <command> <args>
	> <command> <args>; <command> <args>
	> <command> <args>
                           
The command is then executed with the specified arguments.

The possible input commands are as follows:
  
  # A comment (one line per #)
  
  bounds xLow yLow xHigh yHigh The bounds of the four corners of the table
  		initially 0 0 0 0.
  		
  add ID x y vx vy Add a new ball with a specified ID and position x y
  		as well as velocity vx and vy in the x and y direction 
  		respectively.
  
  rad r The radius of all balls, can only be increased.
  
  load filename Read the file as if it all the commands had just
  		been entered.
  
  write filename Write a script that would reproduce the state of
  		the table into filename.
  
  near x y d Print all balls and their variables whose center is
  		within distance d of x, y.
  
  near x * d Print all balls and their variables whose center is
  		within distance d of x along the x axis.

  near * y d Print all balls and their variables whose center is
  		within distance d of y along the y axis.
  
  print Print all points in the quadTree
  
  simulate t Simulate time for t long. All balls will move to
  		the new position calculated from the time and their
  		velocity.
  
  quit End the program
 
Command input is free-format; commands (other than comments) 
may cross line boundaries, and multiple commands are allowed on a line.

EXAMPLE: 

In the following, input from the terminal is marked with a "> " prompt.
